   </table>

   <p>I am documenting my journey through web development in hopes that this could inspire my two daughters, Adalie and Pearl.  
       They are an inspiration to me and it is because of them that I continue to push to new levels.</p>  
       
    <p>I do not have a traditional IT upbringing/background.  Most of my professional career, I have worked in Higher Education 
        roles ranging from customer service (talking with students), to operations management (in a Financial Aid Office).</p>
       
    <p>I was the first in my family to receive a Bachelor's degree and did so at the age of 29 (one month before I turned 30!).  My degree was in Business Finance. My 
       only real experience with technology was Microsoft Excel.  I had no special knowledge, degree, training, or connections- just a 
    new found love for technology and data.</p>

    <p>
       In 2017, I found out I was having my first daughter Pearl.  I had saved up enough sick time at work to take three months off for paternity leave - I was thankful that 
       I sacrificed so much to earn those days.  In that time, I thought about the future and what I wanted it to look like.  I knew I had a knack for making sense of data
       and being able to ask the right questions of it.  I also knew that I loved to use Excel to make formulas or calculations.  
    </p>

    <p>It was during this time that I realized I wanted to pursue a career in data.  I started teaching myself Python and enrolled in a Data Science Immersive 3-month program 
        at Galvanize, a local school in Arizona.  Talk about jumping in head first!  I was exposed to Python, Machine Learning, SQL, CLI, Github....you name it!  At times, I was 
    unsure if I made the right call to quit my full-time job to pursue my new-found passion; however, I pushed through and successfully completed the program. </p>

    <p>My first job following the Data Science immersive program was as a Teacher's Assistant with University of Arizona for a Data Analytics and Visualization bootcamp.  I once again was exposed to 
        even more new languages - HTML, CSS, JS, D3.JS.  Once again, I was trying to drink water out of a firehose (while trying to help others)
    </p>

    <p>While I was working part-time with University of Arizona, I accepted a position as a Data Analyst with Arizona State Univesrity.  I was fortunate enough to have been selected to work 
        within the Action Lab at EdPlus, where I was surrounded by highly skilled-intelligent colleagues.  I also had a great mentor in my hiring manager, Mike Sharkey, whom I will be forever endebted to
        for giving me a shot.  Mike - you are the man!
